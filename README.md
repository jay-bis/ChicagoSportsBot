# ChicagoSportsBot

This simple bot uses the BeautifulSoup library along side PRAW to access data from Reddit (and more specifically, my favorite subreddits),
and then scrape data from posts in those subreddits containing Twitter links.  The obtained text gets put into a .txt file for reading.

Note - I have included my twitter.txt and postIDs.txt files as an example of what the output of running this bot looks like.
